# deeplearning_pj1

This repository contains necessary code for project of the lesson Neural Network and Deep Learning. 

The project uses the MNIST dataset, which is saved in the 'dataset' folder. The main script is test_train.py in main branch, which is for training an MLP or CNN model. The code for models and trainers, etc is saved in the folder 'mynn'. 

Note that we do not specifically implement a script for finding hyperparameters, since we believe that it does not make sense. Instead, we focus on trying different strategies and different frameworks of models in this project.
